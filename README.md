# Foot-Drop-Assistive-Device
Foot drop is a condition where patients cannot lift the front of the foot, causing toe dragging, tripping, and falls. There is a need for a lightweight, affordable, and intelligent assistive device that supports dorsiflexion, adapts to real walking conditions, and aids both rehabilitation and daily use.
