# Foot-Drop-Assistive-Device
Foot drop is a condition where patients cannot lift the front of the foot, causing toe dragging, tripping, and falls. There is a need for a lightweight, affordable, and intelligent assistive device that supports dorsiflexion, adapts to real walking conditions, and aids both rehabilitation and daily use.

#Concept
This project aims to design and develop a lightweight, affordable, and intelligent assistive device that can actively support dorsiflexion in real time. By integrating embedded systems, sensors, and actuation mechanisms, the device adapts to different terrains and walking speeds, making it suitable for both rehabilitation purposes and everyday use. The goal is to enhance safety, improve walking efficiency, and promote independence for individuals affected by foot drop.
